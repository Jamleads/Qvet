## Description

Qvet is an open-source QR code/link tree application designed to manage and generate QR codes for various purposes.

- **Event Management**: Streamline the process of event ticketing and booking using QR codes. This eliminates the need for physical tickets and provides a convenient, paperless solution.
- **Customizable Event Tags and Flyers**: Upload templates for event tags and flyers, which can then be automatically populated with names and embedded QR codes. This feature is particularly useful for conferences, seminars, and other events where attendees and speakers need to be easily identifiable.
- **Design and Download**: Create, customize, and print or download event tags and flyers directly from the application. This saves time and ensures consistency across all event materials.
